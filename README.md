# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. Using NodeJS and MongoDB to allow users to create, edit, and remove documents on a server.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
